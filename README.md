# JPA-Gamified-Marketing-Application
A web application to manage an online questionnaire that interact with a database. This JPA project was an optional assignment of the course Data Bases II of professor Piero Fraternali from Politecnico di Milano (AY 2020/2021) and was developed with my colleague and friend Daniele Nicol√≤ (@DanyKun97).
